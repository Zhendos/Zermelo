# Zermelo Api

Tabor Zermelo API written in Python3.
ZPortal Zermelo is using POST methods.
We can easily send 'fake packages' as a POST request to login and receive data.

## Virtual login

```Python
Api.login('username', 'password')
```

## Information

This API is currently under development and only usuable for College Tabor.
I will try to program it later as a global API, so in the parameters
any school can be passed in.
